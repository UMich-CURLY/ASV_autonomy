# ROS2 Interface for the UWB Tracking Demos of Decawave's MDEK1001

The `ros2` branch is based on [this repository](https://github.com/lauritz1000/uwb-tracking-ros2), which was created by [Lauritz](https://github.com/lauritz1000).

<!-- This repository is forked from https://github.com/cliansang/uwb-tracking-ros and adapted for use with ROS2 -->

Please note that the `uwb_tracking_ros2` package depends on another ROS2 package, `citrack_ros_msgs`, for custom messages. Both packages are provided in this `ros2` branch.
It is expected that these two packages are placed in the **_src_** folder of _your ROS2 workspace_.

For detailed ROS2 setup and installation instructions, please see the [README](uwb_tracking_ros2/README.md) of `uwb_tracking_ros2` package.
